# pWnOS v2.0 Writeup

Unlike most Vulnhub VMs, this one had a static IP of **10.10.10.100**, so no need do a ping sweep to find its IP.


## Recon/Enumeration

The nmap scan returned only port 22 and 80 open.  I always like to start with port 80 during these assessments.


### Port 80

For webpages, I like to run nikto and dirb scans to locate any interesting directories and possible vulnerabilities.  The nikto scan didn't return anything interesting so I moved on to dirb.

The dirb scan returned some interesting directories.  The one that stood out to me was **/blog**.  After inspecting the directory, I found this:

Within one of the files, I was able to find the web app name and version: **Simple PHP Blog 0.3.8**.  With this information I searched **searchsploit** for any known exploits.  I found one that wiped the password file for the web app and created a new user.

## Exploitation

I created a new user under the web app blog and I tried to upload a **php reverse shell** under images.

The upload was a success! So I opened up a handler on metasploit.

I gained access to a php shell, so now I need to escalate my privileges.  


## Privilege Escalation


I upgraded to a TTY shell using 
```python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
```

I nomrally use this [enumeration script](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) to speed up the process.
I found an interesting file within the home directory called <b>mysqli_connect.php</b>.

Unfortunately, this file didnt help, but I backtracked to <b>/var/<b> and found another copy with different credentials.

Using those credentials, I was able to login to mysql and enumerate the databases and tables.

I was stuck for a bit trying to use an exploit on mysql, so I took a step back and tried something simple.  I took the original mysql login and I tried to login to the root user on the machine.

The credentials actually worked... DON'T forget to try the simple solutions...
