## Background

<p>Senior Computer Information Systems student with expected graduation in December 2017.  I am currently pursuing a CCNA Cyber Ops certification, with a scholarship directly from Cisco.  After that, I am planning to sign up for the Offensive Security Certified Professional course (OSCP) near September 2017.  In my spare time I practice penetration testing on vulnerable machines and I also experiment with homelabs.  I am also a mechanical keyboard enthusiast.</p>
